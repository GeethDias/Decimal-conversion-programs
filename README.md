## Introduction
Decimal numbers are converted into binary, hexadecimal, and octal representations using C programs in this repository. Each program is designed to take a decimal number as input and provide the corresponding representation as output.

## Programs

### decimalintobinary.c
This program converts a decimal number into its binary representation.

### decimalintohexadecimal.c
This program converts a decimal number into its hexadecimal representation.

### decimalintooctal.c
This program converts a decimal number into its octal representation.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the C programs using a C compiler (e.g., GCC).
3. Run the desired program and follow the on-screen instructions to input a decimal number.
4. The program will display the converted representation.
